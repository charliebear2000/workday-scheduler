# Work Day Scheduler

## General Info
This is an assignment for the Coding Bootcamp. I was provided starter code that had most of the styling included. The assignment requirements included:
* When the planner is opened, the current day is displayed at the top of the screen.
* The page has time blocks for standard business hours.
* Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
* When you click on the time block, you can enter an event.
* When you click on the save button to the right, then the event is saved into local storage.
* When you refresh the page, then the event persists.
